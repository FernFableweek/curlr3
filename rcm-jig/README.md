# 3D-printable RCM jig for the Switch

This little jig will let you enter RCM mode without having to sacrifice a
Joy-Con or hold a piece of wire. You will need to break up a Micro USB connector
to get at the pin contact wafer inside, remove all but pins 1 and 4 (which
will contact pins 7 and 10 on the Switch respectively), short them together
at the rear, then insert the wafer into the 3D printed jig. Trim it to fit and
superglue it in place, then verify that the placement looks good.
